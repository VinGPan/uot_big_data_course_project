Airbnb is an online platform which enables its user to lease or rent variety of short-term housing options. Airbnb is particularly popular with travellers who are looking for home-like staying experience at tourist destinations. Users on Airbnb can book a place to stay in 34,000+ cities across 190+ countries.

The data behind the Inside Airbnb site (http://insideairbnb.com/) scrapes publicly available information from the Airbnb site and makes the such data available for free. This data includes detailed description of available listings, booking calendar, user reviews etc. The data has been bifurcated based on city of the listing.

Objective of this project is to analyse Airbnb listings for Toronto city and provide some useful insights. We are interested in following questions:

How are the listings distributed geographically?
What different types of listings are available and how are they priced?
Are the listings really short term?
Additional objective of this project is to build Listing Price Prediction model. We will be making use various attributes of the listing and will engineer few more. The model can be used by both new and existing home owners to decide on optimal price for their property.

We will make use of Apache Spark services of Databricks data analytics platform to carryout this project.
